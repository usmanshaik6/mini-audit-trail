# Mini Audit Trail Generator

A full-stack application built using **Next.js**, **React**, and **TypeScript** that automatically tracks text changes and maintains a **version history audit trail**.  
Every modification captures **added words, removed words, timestamp, word count, and a unique version ID**.

Designed as a **scenario-based intern task** to prove originality, logic-building, and full-stack skills.
